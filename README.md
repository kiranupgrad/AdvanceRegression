# Project Name: Housing Price Regression Assignment
Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, has made the decision to join the Australian market. The company buys houses below market value and resells them for a greater price.  The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information

### Business Goal
The goal of the company is:
  - To determine factors (like LotFrontage, LotArea, GarageArea) that may influence the house price in the Australian market.
  - To develop a regression model using regularisation based on those factors, that would explain the variations in the house price.
  - To know the R-squared or Mean Squared Error of the model, i.e. how well those factors capture the price of the house.
  - To ascertain the best lambda value for lasso and ridge regression. 

## About Dataset
The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file.


## Conclusions
Top 6 predictors which have potential to influence property prices:
- OverallQual
- GrLivArea
- GarageCars
- BsmtFullBath
- TotRmsAbvGrd
- OverallCond
